# Expansion drivers and attached devices

Expansion drivers turn named buses and safe GPIO slots into active displays,
radios, sensors, or manual resource profiles. Drivers are package-gated, so the
available list depends on the firmware and board.

Integrated hardware uses the same composition model. A board profile declares
its fixed buses and default attachments, which are created at boot, shown by
`expansion devices`, and cannot be detached. For example, Freenove `touch0` is
an `ft6336` attachment; Waveshare `rtc0` and `environment0` use `pcf85063` and
`shtc3`; and the supported battery boards expose `battery0` through
`battery-adc`. TTGO VGA32 `keyboard0` is a `ps2-keyboard` attachment. Built-in
audio also appears as `audio0`: Waveshare uses `es8311-es7210`, Freenove uses
`es8311-duplex`, and classic ESP32 audio boards use `esp32-dac`. CL-32 declares
its integrated AVR as fixed `core0`; its polled event FIFO supplies the
`keyboard0` input source and its voltage and power-status registers supply
`battery0`. Generic input, time, sensor, battery, and audio services consume the
same runtime providers whether the attachment came from the board profile or
the shell.

Built-in displays follow the same rule and appear as fixed `display0`
attachments: Waveshare uses `st7305`, Freenove uses `st7796`, ODROID-GO uses
`ili9341`, Elecrow CrowPanel uses `ssd1683`, ESP32-WROVER v3.0 uses `cvbs-pal`,
and TTGO VGA32 uses `vga32`. They attach before the splash and primary display
service start.

Built-in SDMMC slots also appear as fixed `storage0` attachments. Waveshare and
ESP32-WROVER v3.0 use one-bit bindings; Freenove uses four-bit bindings. The
attachment claims and configures the pins early, while the normal storage phase
still probes and mounts the card.

Named MIDI connections are created as buses rather than attached drivers. Use
`expansion bus create midi <name> tx=<gpio> rx=<gpio>`; SolarOS chooses the UART
backend and the `midi` background job owns the connection while it runs.

## Discover what is present

```text
expansion
expansion status
expansion drivers
expansion devices
display list
```

`expansion` opens the device manager. Its Devices view lists current
attachments and opens their details; detachable runtime devices can be removed
after confirmation. Its Drivers view groups drivers by category and opens an
attachment form for drivers supported by the running board. Binding forms use
existing named buses; create, attach, detach, or remove buses in the `io` app.
`expansion status` retains the textual capabilities, buses, devices, and claims
report for scripts and terminal inspection.

`expansion drivers` groups compiled drivers under bold Audio, Display, Input,
Power, Radio, Sensor, Storage, and Utility headings, with driver names sorted
inside each category. Its aligned rows also show probe support, bus type, and
the driver summary. `expansion devices` prints each attached device in a
separate block, with its name in bold followed by origin, readiness, startup
mode, attachment policy, and bindings.

From a script, inspect `solaros.expansion.drivers()` and
`solaros.expansion.devices()`. A driver existing in firmware does not mean a
physical device is attached.

## Attach deliberately

Use real bus and pin names returned by discovery:

```text
expansion attach pcd8544 lcd0 spi=spi0 cs=gpio10 dc=gpio4 reset=gpio5
display test lcd0
expansion detach lcd0
```

Detaching releases the resources. Do not invent a target name or copy bindings
from a different board.

A Waveshare 4.2-inch V2 monochrome e-paper module uses the SSD1683 expansion
driver and registers a 400x300 display target:

```text
expansion attach ssd1683 epd0 spi=spi0 cs=gpio10 dc=gpio17 reset=gpio16 busy=gpio15
display test epd0
display mode epd0 refresh=fast
expansion detach epd0
```

The runtime defaults are the Waveshare V2 panel profile, 2 MHz SPI, and
rotation 0. Optional `power=<gpio>`, `clock=<khz>`, `rotation=<0..3>`, and
`panel=<0..3>` bindings adapt the same driver to integrated panels. Panel 0
selects Elecrow BUSY-based revision detection and defaults to rotation 2;
panels 1, 2, and 3 select the legacy Elecrow, green-sticker Elecrow, and
Waveshare V2 profiles.

Use the module's eight-wire SPI connector and power it from the same 3.3 V
logic domain as the ESP32. The module keeps its last image after detach.
If SolarOS creates a display shell on `epd0`, run `sessions`, close that session
with `session close <id>`, and then detach the expansion.

An M5Stack Unit CardKB attaches at its fixed I2C address and becomes a shared
keyboard source for the shell and foreground apps:

```text
expansion attach cardkb cardkb0 i2c=i2c0 addr=0x5f
input test cardkb0
expansion detach cardkb0
```

The CardKB firmware produces characters after key release. SolarOS maps its
four navigation values to the same logical arrow keys used by PS/2 and BLE
keyboards. The module's Fn combinations are device-specific and are ignored.

RTC and environmental sensor modules use the same named-I2C lifecycle. Only one
provider of each service type can be active at a time:

```text
expansion attach pcf85063 rtc0 i2c=i2c0 addr=0x51
expansion attach shtc3 environment0 i2c=i2c0 addr=0x70
date
temperature
humidity
expansion detach environment0
expansion detach rtc0
```

The PCF85063 `irq=<gpio>` binding is optional. The Waveshare board profile
reserves its routed RTC interrupt on GPIO15; external modules can omit `irq`
when only clock and calendar access is required.
The generic RTC service discovers alarm, countdown, and interrupt-status
support from the attached chip adapter, so applications do not depend on the
PCF85063 register interface.

`battery-adc` takes an ADC pin and a divider ratio in thousandths. For a 2:1
resistive divider, use `divider=2000`:

```text
expansion attach battery-adc battery0 adc=gpio4 divider=2000
battery
expansion detach battery0
```

Use a high-impedance divider suitable for the expected battery voltage. The
divided voltage must remain inside the ESP32 ADC input range.

Other input devices follow the same lifecycle:

```text
expansion attach gpio-keys keys0 key:UP=gpio17 key:ENTER=gpio2
expansion attach rotary-encoder wheel0 a=gpio17 b=gpio2
expansion bus create ps2 ps2mouse clock=gpio17 data=gpio18
expansion attach ps2-mouse mouse0 ps2=ps2mouse
expansion attach analog-joystick joystick0 x=adc2 y=adc4 min=0 center=1650 max=3300 deadzone=100
input status
```

Use only bindings listed by `expansion drivers` and resources shown on the
running board. A rotary encoder decodes interrupts from its quadrature A/B
signals and publishes Up/Down detents; wire its independent push switch through
`gpio-keys`. A PS/2 mouse publishes relative pointer events. An analog joystick
consumes two scalar streams and publishes axes, never keys.
Foreground Python and Lua applications receive those pointer and axis events
through `solaros.input`; use `solaros.tui.getch()` for keyboard characters.

On a board without built-in SD hardware, an SPI microSD adapter can provide
removable storage. The SPI bus must include MISO and declare the selected CS
pin. Attaching mounts the detected FAT volume at `/sdcard`. Unmount it before
detaching the adapter:

```text
expansion attach sdspi card0 spi=spi0 cs=gpio4
disk lsblk
disk umount
expansion detach card0
```

The `sdspi` attach command prints the card probe result to the invoking shell.
The report includes the card identity, type, negotiated speed, capacity, CSD/SSR
details, mount point, and any underlying block-I/O or FatFs mount error.

An SDMMC adapter uses direct clock, command, and data bindings. On ESP32-S3 the
signals can use the GPIO matrix. Classic ESP32 accepts only the native slot-1
pinout: CLK GPIO14, CMD GPIO15, D0 GPIO2, and optionally D1 GPIO4, D2 GPIO12,
D3 GPIO13.

```text
expansion attach sdmmc card0 clk=gpio14 cmd=gpio15 d0=gpio2
disk lsblk
disk umount
expansion detach card0
```

An RFM95W wired to the ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 `spi0` bus with NSS on GPIO4 and
reset on GPIO5 attaches as a multimode packet radio:

```text
expansion attach rfm95 radio0 spi=spi0 cs=gpio4 reset=gpio5
radio status radio0
radio profile apply radio0 lora-eu868
```

Connect an antenna suitable for the module band before transmitting. See the
expansion reference for the complete wiring and modulation configuration.

Use `rfm69` for the 13 dBm RFM69W/CW modules and `rfm69h` for the 20 dBm
RFM69HW/HCW variants. For example:

```text
expansion attach rfm69h radio0 spi=spi0 cs=gpio4 reset=gpio5
radio config radio0 power 20
```

Both variants are 3.3 V devices. High-power transmission requires a supply that
can sustain the module's transmit-current peak and an antenna appropriate for
the selected band.

A WS2812/NeoPixel strip uses one runtime-safe GPIO and a declared pixel count:

```text
expansion attach neopixel pixels0 data=gpio1 count=8
neopixel fill pixels0 16 0 0
neopixel set pixels0 3 0 16 0
neopixel clear pixels0
expansion detach pixels0
```

SolarOS stores colors in RGB form and transmits the strip's standard GRB wire
order. Attach clears all declared pixels. `set` and `fill` refresh immediately
in the shell; scripting APIs buffer changes until `show()`.

An LEDC PWM audio output uses one runtime-safe PWM pin and appears as a normal
mono playback device:

```text
expansion attach audio-pwm pwm0 pwm=gpio1
audio devices
audio default pwm0
aplay /audio/example.mp3
audio default auto
expansion detach pwm0
```

The output is 8-bit PWM with a 78.125 kHz carrier and a 16 kHz native PCM rate.
It is a signal output, not a speaker driver. Put a reconstruction low-pass
filter, DC-blocking/coupling stage, and suitable amplifier between the GPIO and
a speaker. A bare speaker can overload and damage the GPIO. Only one LEDC PWM
audio device can be attached at a time.

A PCM5102A module uses three runtime-safe GPIOs and appears as a normal stereo
playback device:

```text
expansion attach pcm5102 dac0 bck=gpio1 din=gpio2 rck=gpio3
audio devices
audio default dac0
aplay /audio/example.mp3
audio default auto
expansion detach dac0
```

The example pins are valid on the Waveshare board. Connect the module's SCK pin
to ground; the driver emits 64 BCK cycles per stereo frame so the PCM5102A can
derive its system clock with the internal PLL. The driver registers
`dac0.playback` as an exclusive 16 kHz, 16-bit PCM sink. Mono input is
duplicated to both channels and device volume is applied in software. Current
dual-I2S boards use I2S1, leaving onboard audio or composite video on I2S0.
PCM5102A modules provide line-level output; connect an amplifier or powered
input rather than a passive speaker.

A PCM1808 module uses four runtime-safe GPIOs and appears as a stereo capture
device:

```text
expansion attach pcm1808 adc0 mclk=gpio1 bck=gpio2 ws=gpio3 dout=gpio17
audio devices
arecord -d 5 -i adc0.capture /sdcard/pcm1808.wav
expansion detach adc0
```

The example consumes every runtime-safe GPIO on the Waveshare expansion
header. Before applying power, configure the module for slave I2S mode:
`MD1=0`, `MD0=0`, and `FMT=0`. Connect `MCLK` to the module's `SCKI` or `SCK`
pin, `WS` to `LRCK`, and `DOUT` to `DOUT`. The driver supplies a 4.096 MHz
system clock and 64 BCK cycles per 16 kHz stereo frame, receives the PCM1808's
24-bit samples, and registers `adc0.capture` as an exclusive signed 16-bit PCM
source. Use the module-rated supply and a common ground; raw PCM1808 circuits
need separate analog and digital supplies as specified by the manufacturer.
On modules that expose both rails, connect `+5V` for the analog supply and
`3.3V` for the digital supply; powering only `3.3V` leaves the converter's
analog section unpowered.

The integrated codec and classic ESP32 DAC backends are also attachable when
the target MCU and board resources support them. Codec attachments need a
named I2C bus, an I2S controller, and all six audio GPIO signals:

```text
expansion attach es8311-es7210 audio0 i2c=i2c0 i2s=i2s0 mclk=gpio38 bck=gpio14 ws=gpio13 din=gpio12 dout=gpio45 pa=gpio46
expansion attach es8311-duplex audio0 i2c=i2c0 i2s=i2s0 mclk=gpio42 bck=gpio10 ws=gpio11 din=gpio12 dout=gpio9 pa=gpio46
```

`es8311-es7210` and `es8311-duplex` are ESP32-S3 drivers. `esp32-dac` is for the
classic ESP32 internal DAC on GPIO25 or GPIO26. Its optional `neg` binding
enables differential output, and `amp` plus `active=0|1` controls an amplifier
enable pin:

```text
expansion attach esp32-dac audio0 pos=gpio26 amp=gpio25 active=1
```

Only one of these primary audio backends can be attached at a time. A fixed
board-default `audio0` cannot be detached.

The integrated display controller drivers can also create auxiliary display
targets. Use a name other than the reserved primary name `display0` for a
runtime attachment. Each controller driver supports one attached instance, so
its board-integrated `display0` and an auxiliary instance cannot coexist:

```text
expansion attach st7305 lcd0 spi=spi0 cs=gpio10 dc=gpio4 reset=gpio5
expansion attach ili9341 lcd0 spi=spi0 cs=gpio10 dc=gpio4 reset=gpio5 bl=gpio6 pwm=1 active=1
expansion attach st7796 lcd0 spi=spi0 cs=gpio10 dc=gpio4 reset=gpio5 bl=gpio6 pwm=1 active=1
display test lcd0
expansion detach lcd0
```

`st7305`, `st7796`, and `ili9341` are available on ESP32 and ESP32-S3 firmware.
The I2S-based `cvbs-pal` and `vga32` drivers are available on classic ESP32.
Composite PAL uses I2S0 and GPIO25. VGA32 uses I2S1 plus its six RGB and two
sync GPIOs; see the expansion reference for its full binding list. A fixed
board-default `display0` cannot be detached.

## Quick reference

solaros.expansion.drivers() lists compiled drivers and devices() lists
currently attached devices with normalized bindings. attach(driver, name,
bindings) and detach(name) manage them. Never assume an example name such as
lcd0 or oled0 exists; inspect devices() or use a name explicitly supplied by
the user. Foreground scripts consume attached pointer and axis sources through
solaros.input.
