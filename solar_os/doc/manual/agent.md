# Native SolarOS agent

The `agent` application is a foreground chat that can inspect the current
device, consult this manual, edit files, and run installed Python or Lua
runtimes. It exposes only tools allowed by the current firmware and tool policy.

## Configure it

The Responses API is recommended for OpenAI reasoning models:

```text
agent config endpoint https://api.openai.com/v1/responses
agent config model gpt-model
agent config key api-key
agent config reasoning medium
agent config tools confirm
agent config max-tools 16
agent status
```

The default `confirm` policy runs read-only tools automatically and asks before
sensitive reads, file changes, or script execution. Use `readonly` when the
agent should only inspect the system.

## Start a conversation

Run `agent` or `agent new`, enter a message, and wait for the response. The
bottom bar shows
the latest input, output, and total token counts. Tool activity stays in the
conversation, while usage does not.

Completed turns are saved. Inspect and resume them explicitly:

```text
agent list
agent resume SLOT
agent delete SLOT
```

Slots are numbered `1` through `3` on internal flash or `1` through `8` on SD.
When all slots are occupied, a new conversation replaces the oldest one.
`agent resume` restores the transcript. Responses endpoints continue from the
saved provider response ID; Chat Completions endpoints receive a bounded local
message window. Bare `agent` always starts a new conversation.

Use `agent ask PROMPT` for one request. It leaves the answer visible until you
press `Esc` or the app-exit key; one-request answers are not added to the
conversation store.

## Inspect background workloads

The agent can inspect job admission without starting or stopping anything. For
example, ask:

```text
Which background jobs are running, and which stopped jobs could start now?
Why is email-sync waiting?
```

The answer is based on the same worker-stack admission policy used by SolarOS.
It includes current internal and PSRAM headroom, each job's declared stack
placement, generation, current resource claims, start disposition, and last
error. A `ready` disposition covers declared worker-stack admission only; a
job may still need dynamic buffers or an argument-selected resource when it
actually starts.

## Troubleshooting

- `agent status` shows the endpoint, model, policy, request failures, and memory
  telemetry without printing the API key. It also reports how many tool calls
  the last request used from its configured budget.
- If a generated script guesses an API or display name, ask the agent to call
  `solaros_reference` with the language and exact task, then call the relevant
  discovery tool. The reference lookup returns focused sections from the
  firmware's Python and Lua manuals rather than only their page summaries.
- If a call is denied, the model receives a structured denial and can explain
  the result or choose another approach.

## Quick reference

Use `agent` or `agent new` for a new durable foreground conversation,
`agent list` to inspect saved slots, `agent resume SLOT` to restore one, and
`agent delete SLOT` to remove one. `agent ask PROMPT` makes an unsaved one-shot
request. Configure endpoint, model, key, reasoning, tool policy, and maximum
tools with `agent config`. `agent tools` reports the installed typed tools and
their policy disposition. `jobs_list` is read-only and reports actual job
admission and memory state; it does not start or stop jobs. The default
`confirm` policy runs read-only tools and requires local approval for sensitive,
mutating, or disruptive calls. `Esc` or the app-exit key returns to the shell.
