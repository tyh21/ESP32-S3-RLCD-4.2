# MeshCore companion messaging

SolarOS implements a non-forwarding MeshCore companion node. It exchanges
signed adverts, end-to-end encrypted direct messages, acknowledgements, and
shared-key group messages through the provider-neutral Contacts and Messages
services. It can also carry a peer-bound SolarOS virtual serial port through
ordinary encrypted MeshCore direct packets. SolarOS does not repeat traffic or
include MeshCore's Arduino interface, companion protocol, room server, remote
administration, sensors, or telemetry. SolarOS Link remains a separate
protocol; the virtual serial feature only reuses its reliable stream framing.

## Quick start

Attach a packet-capable LoRa radio and start the worker with an explicit
regional profile:

```text
expansion attach rfm95 radio0 spi=spi0 cs=gpio4 reset=gpio5
job start meshcore radio0 meshcore-eu868
meshcore status
chat
```

`meshcore-us915` is the MeshCore "USA/Canada (Recommended)" preset: 910.525 MHz,
62.5 kHz, SF7, coding rate 4/5. `meshcore-eu868` is 869.618 MHz, 62.5 kHz, SF8, coding rate 4/8, a 32-symbol
preamble, sync word `0x12`, CRC, variable packet length, and 14 dBm. It is an
EU868 profile; do not use it outside regions where that frequency and transmit
behavior are legal. The profile argument is mandatory so SolarOS never silently
chooses a region.

The job claims the radio, applies the complete profile, enters receive mode,
and emits one zero-hop advert. It restores the previous radio configuration and
state and releases ownership when stopped or when startup fails. Starting
`radio-link` on the same radio fails with the normal ownership error.

```text
job status meshcore
job stop meshcore
```

## Identity, name, and adverts

The first start generates an Ed25519 identity from the SolarOS RNG and stores
it as an opaque Credentials record. A MeshCore-specific advertised-name
override is optional; without one, SolarOS uses the truncated device
`user@hostname` identity.

```text
meshcore identity show
meshcore identity generate
meshcore identity generate --force
meshcore identity import PRIVATE_KEY_HEX
meshcore identity export --private
meshcore name
meshcore name field-unit
meshcore advert zero
meshcore advert flood
```

Generating with `--force`, importing, or editing channels is rejected while the
job runs. Private export is deliberately explicit and prints a warning.
Treat the output as a password: current NVS is not encrypted, and physical
flash access can recover the stored identity and group keys.

No periodic advert is sent. `meshcore advert zero` reaches only local receivers;
`meshcore advert flood` deliberately requests a network-wide flood.

## Contacts, trust, and messages

A valid advert proves that its sender controls the advertised public key. It
does not prove the person's identity, so the endpoint enters Contacts as
`discovered`. Review it with `contacts show`, then use `contacts trust` or
`contacts block`. Blocked endpoints cannot send or receive direct messages.

Direct messages use MeshCore's public-key/ECDH path. An outbound message waits
for its cryptographic acknowledgement and retries twice after the initial
attempt. A valid ACK marks it delivered; the final timeout marks it failed.
Discovered recipients require Chat confirmation or `messages send
... --allow-untrusted`.

The standard `Public` group is enabled by default. Group messages are encrypted
with a shared key but their embedded sender name is not authenticated, so Chat
always labels them sender-unverified. A group transmission becomes sent after
the radio finishes because groups have no recipient ACK.

```text
meshcore channel list
meshcore channel public off
meshcore channel public on
meshcore channel add '#hansemesh'
meshcore channel add team BASE64_PSK
meshcore channel remove team
```

There are eight total group slots including Public. Custom keys must decode to
16 or 32 bytes and remain confined to Credentials; they are not shown by
Inbox, logs, autocomplete, agent tools, Python, or Lua.

A channel name that starts with `#` is a public hashtag channel. SolarOS derives
its 16-byte key from the first 16 bytes of the SHA-256 digest of the exact
channel name, including the leading `#`. Hashtag names are case-sensitive and
do not take a pre-shared-key argument. Anyone who knows or guesses the name can
derive the same key, so hashtag channels are not private. Use the explicit
Base64 key form only for private channels without the `#` prefix.

## Reliable virtual serial ports

A MeshCore stream is a normal SolarOS byte-stream port carried in encrypted
MeshCore direct-request packets. Standard MeshCore repeaters can route those
opaque packets between two SolarOS endpoints; the repeaters do not need
SolarOS support. Create the stream explicitly on both devices and bind each
side to the other device's trusted MeshCore endpoint.

First start MeshCore on both devices. Use flood adverts when the endpoints are
not in direct radio range, then review and trust the discovered endpoint on
each side:

```text
job start meshcore radio0 meshcore-eu868
meshcore advert flood
contacts list
contacts show <contact-id>
contacts trust <contact-id> <endpoint-id>
meshcore stream create mser0 <endpoint-id>
meshcore stream status mser0
```

Endpoint IDs are local database IDs and can differ between the two devices.
The endpoint must be a trusted MeshCore endpoint with the exact peer public
key. A discovered, blocked, group, or changed identity is rejected. Configure
only one stream for a peer identity.

For example, expose a shell on the internet-connected ground station:

```text
session create shell mser0 --term dumb
```

On the pocket terminal, open it as a serial connection:

```text
com mser0
```

To expose another machine instead, connect its serial interface to the ground
station and bridge the UART port:

```text
job start bridge uart0 mser0
```

The stream is a slow, stop-and-wait serial link, not an IP or Telnet tunnel.
It carries up to 82 data bytes per MeshCore packet, uses 2048-byte transmit and
receive queues, retries after 12 to 16 seconds, and treats a peer as absent
after 180 seconds. Interactive command shells are practical; full-screen TUIs,
bulk transfers, and chatty terminal negotiation are poor fits. Use the `dumb`
terminal mode where possible.

At most two Link-backed streams can exist at once, including MeshCore streams.
Stream definitions remain in RAM if the MeshCore job stops and reconnect after
it starts again, but they do not persist across a reboot. Remove an unclaimed
port with `meshcore stream remove <port>`.

## Implementation and limits

The complete provider context and its 16-packet pool use external-required
PSRAM. Runtime measurement tuned the worker to a 7168-byte internal stack.
`meshcore status`
reports packet usage, traffic, retries, duplicate counts, whether the context
is in PSRAM, and the measured minimum stack watermark. Firmware packages omit
MeshCore unless the board has PSRAM and packet-radio expansion capability.

SolarOS vendors the audited protocol subset from MeshCore commit
`03b6ef4b0de98fc70b49ef10a6d0d61f8381fb7a`. Updates are explicit source
reviews; firmware builds never download protocol code.
