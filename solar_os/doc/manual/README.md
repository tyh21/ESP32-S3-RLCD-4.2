## Applications

- [agent application](apps.md#agent) — Native Responses/Chat-Completions LLM client and SolarOS agent control plane. It streams model text directly to the active shell and exposes typed system-status, storage-listing, job-listing, display-discovery, and optional Python/Lua execution tools. agent tools shows risk, policy, and runtime availability.
- [Agent service and tool reference](agent.service.md) — Provider contract, typed tools, policy, resource bounds, and roadmap
- [aplay application](apps.md#aplay) — Play audio files through the default registered playback endpoint. WAV and MP3 are supported when an output device is present. MP3 decoding is provided by the shared, device-independent audio codec service. aplay prints the source details, plays the file once through the shared background audio player, and then returns to the prompt without clearing existing terminal output. It can be launched from display, UART, USB CDC, Telnet, and other port shells.
- [Application reference](apps.md) — Usage, controls, and examples for every foreground application
- [arecord application](apps.md#arecord) — Record a registered capture endpoint to a WAV file. The default is the first compatible input; -i selects a specific stream such as adc0.capture. This requires a registered input device, but not built-in board audio. With -d, recording stops after the specified number of seconds. Without -d, recording continues until app-exit, the storage fills, or the WAV size limit is reached. It can be launched from display, UART, USB CDC, Telnet, and other port shells.
- [calc application](apps.md#calc) — Scientific calculator and function plotter. On a graphical display, calc opens an expression list beside a Cartesian plot. From UART, USB CDC, Telnet, or any other text-only shell, the same command opens a scientific REPL without the plot pane. calc --tui forces that REPL even when graphics are available.
- [chat application](apps.md#chat) — Tabbed provider-neutral conversation client. The Channels tab lists gateway and radio conversations. Enter selects a conversation and opens its bounded shared history on the Chat tab, which also contains the message/command input. The app opens and remains useful offline; network or radio transport jobs connect independently.
- [clock application](apps.md#clock) — Full-screen graphical seven-segment clock, alarm countdown, and stopwatch. The countdown is serviced in the background, so it continues when the Clock session is suspended. It works without RTC hardware while SolarOS remains powered. With a wired RTC interrupt, the RTC alarm or countdown is also armed and explicit light sleep can wake for it.
- [com application](apps.md#com) — Serial terminal for a bidirectional byte-stream port. Display-keyboard or port-shell input is forwarded to the selected port, and received bytes are drawn in the active terminal. The port may be a UART or a virtual port such as a peer-bound SolarOS Link stream.
- [contacts application](apps.md#contacts) — Provider-neutral address book for gateway and MeshCore identities. Contacts can carry multiple provider endpoints while retaining trust independently for each endpoint. A signed MeshCore advert creates a discovered endpoint: the signature proves possession of the advertised key, not the human identity behind it.
- [curl application](apps.md#curl) — HTTP client for quick text downloads and diagnostics. It can print response data to the terminal or save it to a file.
- [edit application](apps.md#edit) — Text editor for files on mounted storage. It supports cursor navigation, selection, clipboard operations, text-size changes, and syntax highlighting for known source files. The editor supports files up to 256 KiB on boards with PSRAM and 32 KiB on boards without PSRAM. Use hexedit for binary files.
- [email application](apps.md#email) — Receive-only IMAPS client for the configured mailbox. The app shows the provider-specific message list while every newly synchronized message is also published to the universal inbox and its shared status-bar unread counter.
- [files application](apps.md#files) — File manager inspired by Midnight Commander. Its normal mode provides two panes for copy, move, delete, and launch workflows on mounted storage. Launcher mode provides a minimal single-pane application menu suitable for a startup script.
- [Flash another ESP board](flash.md) — Download verified SolarOS factory images and program another ESP board over UART
- [flash application](apps.md#flash) — Download verified SolarOS factory artifacts to SD and program another supported ESP board over UART. The browser refreshes the signed catalog on request and shows which board, flavor, and version artifacts are already cached. Its tree starts folded and retains its selection and fold state after operations. Delete removes a selected cached artifact after confirmation. The shell form accepts a named UART plus optional boot and reset GPIO pins.
- [ftp application](apps.md#ftp) — Two-pane FTP file manager. The left pane is local mounted storage. The right pane is a remote FTP server. The app uses unencrypted IPv4 FTP and passive data connections.
- [funcgen application](apps.md#funcgen) — Audio-only function generator built on the shared real-time Synth service. It emits signed 16-bit stereo PCM and can use the default playback device or an explicitly selected runtime playback stream, including an attached LEDC PWM audio expansion.
- [gameboy application](apps.md#gameboy) — Original Game Boy (DMG) emulator selected by the gameboy group on boards with PSRAM, SD storage, graphics, and a streaming display. Current integrated targets are Waveshare RLCD, Freenove IPS, ODROID-GO, Freenove PAL, and TTGO VGA32. The application loads a user-supplied ROM into PSRAM and writes battery-backed cartridge RAM beside it as a .sav file. Game Boy Color-only ROMs and ROMs larger than 4 MiB are rejected.
- [help application](apps.md#help) — Foreground browser for the package-aware SolarOS manual. The foldable tree groups the topics compiled for the current firmware and shows whether it is using the embedded copy or a verified downloaded revision. All groups start folded. The selection, scroll position, and fold state remain unchanged after a topic closes.
- [hexedit application](apps.md#hexedit) — Two-pane binary editor for files on mounted storage. Each row shows a file offset, hexadecimal bytes, and their synchronized printable ASCII view. The number of bytes per row adapts to the terminal width. It uses the same 256 KiB PSRAM and 32 KiB internal-memory limits as edit.
- [inbox application](apps.md#inbox) — Universal incoming-message browser for pages, chat notifications, mail, and other background producers. It reads the same shared inbox that supplies the status-bar unread count. Messages and read state survive reboot in the bounded /.inbox/messages.bin store; the service retains at most 64 entries and keeps the file below 32 KB even when internal flash is the only storage.
- [invaders application](apps.md#invaders) — Graphical arcade shooter.
- [io application](apps.md#io) — Interactive expansion I/O manager. Its default Layout view presents the board's connectors in their physical arrangement, followed by the existing pin, named-bus, and resource-claim views. It uses the same ownership and validation services as the gpio, i2c, spi, uart, midi, onewire, and expansion commands.
- [launcher application](apps.md#launcher) — Configurable native graphical launcher for display shells. It draws the configured grid, centers one icon in each occupied cell, and shows the selected icon larger with its title centered underneath. Arrow keys move between occupied cells, Enter opens the selection, and a pointer selects and opens items by point and click. Esc or the app-exit key returns to the shell.
- [less application](apps.md#less) — Terminal pager for text files. It preserves original text layout and is useful for quick file inspection.
- [logic application](apps.md#logic) — On-device logic analyzer waveform viewer. It displays the latest capture made by the shared logic analyzer service or the SUMP job. With pin arguments it makes a new local capture before opening the viewer.
- [lua application](apps.md#lua) — Embedded Lua runtime. It can run an interactive REPL or execute .lua scripts from storage. Lua scripts can use SolarOS service bindings when the selected firmware includes the corresponding packages. Foreground scripts can consume touch coordinates, relative mouse motion, buttons, and joystick axes through solaros.input.
- [Native SolarOS agent](agent.md) — Configure and use the resumable LLM agent and its typed tools
- [notes application](apps.md#notes) — Markdown-backed checklist and category manager. It stores unchecked and checked items and supports one level of category folding. A persistent bottom help bar shows the available controls, with status or text input directly above it.
- [player application](apps.md#player) — Interactive WAV/MP3 player and the user-facing counterpart to aplay. player keeps a persistent playlist under .player on the current storage root. Opening an audio file from Files adds it to that playlist, selects it, and starts playback. Missing files remain listed so removable media can be reattached.
- [Playground](playground.md) — Browse, install, uninstall, and run community Python and Lua applications
- [playground application](apps.md#playground) — Browse the configured community catalog as a foldable category tree, search applications, and install, update, uninstall, or run Python and Lua scripts.
- [plot application](apps.md#plot) — Graphical plotter for DAQ CSV files and live scalar streams. It is compatible with CSV generated by the daq job.
- [python application](apps.md#python) — Embedded MicroPython runtime. It can run an interactive REPL, .py scripts, or .mpy files from storage. Python scripts can use SolarOS service bindings when the selected firmware includes the corresponding packages. Foreground scripts can consume touch coordinates, relative mouse motion, buttons, and joystick axes through solaros.input.
- [reader application](apps.md#reader) — Graphical document reader for plain text, Markdown, and EPUB. It remembers reading position and zoom per opened file when storage is available.
- [recorder application](apps.md#recorder) — Interactive GUI/TUI counterpart to arecord. Recorder writes PCM WAV files so the channel count, sample rate, and resolution travel with the recording and the result can be played immediately. It accepts any registered signed-16-bit PCM capture stream. On the Waveshare board it initially selects audio0.capture. Mono/stereo output, 8/16-bit file resolution, and sample rates from 8 kHz through 48 kHz are converted from the selected stream as necessary.
- [scp application](apps.md#scp) — SCP file transfer over SSH. It supports password or key authentication through the shared SSH transport and host lookup/known-host storage. When user@ is omitted, SCP uses the NVS-backed SolarOS identity user. Tab completion reads aliases from /.ssh/hosts, preserves an explicit user@ prefix, and appends : after a unique host match.
- [sheet application](apps.md#sheet) — CSV viewer for small data tables. It is intended as a companion to daq logs and simple spreadsheet-like inspection.
- [sketch application](apps.md#sketch) — Pointer-driven graphical paint application. Its layout follows classic desktop paint programs: Save, Open, Import, and the sidebar controls share one aligned, equal-sized button grid; color and pattern choices are in the bottom bar. Sketch uses a compact four-color canvas and stores finished documents as interoperable indexed-color PNG files. Color TFTs show the native palette; one-bit displays use the existing dithered rendering path.
- [ssh application](apps.md#ssh) — Interactive SSH client. It supports password and key authentication, known hosts, hostname lookup through /.ssh/hosts, UTF-8 text, VT-style controls, and remote full-screen terminal applications. When user@ is omitted, SSH uses the NVS-backed SolarOS identity user. Tab completion reads aliases from /.ssh/hosts and preserves an explicit user@ prefix.
- [synth application](apps.md#synth) — Open the native synthesizer and sound designer:
- [telnet application](apps.md#telnet) — Telnet client for classic TCP terminal sessions. It supports basic Telnet option negotiation, terminal type reporting, window size reporting, and raw mode.
- [view application](apps.md#view) — Graphical image viewer. It supports the image formats compiled into the current firmware, including common PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP paths and automatic animated GIF playback when the media package is enabled. Images are decoded as RGB on a negotiated indexed-color display and as grayscale on a one-bit display. In the default fit mode, JPEG color conversion writes display-sized output directly, so a large source photograph does not require a full-size RGB destination.
- [web application](apps.md#web) — Simple graphical web browser for lightweight HTML pages. It shares document and image rendering infrastructure with reader where possible. Embedded and direct PNG, JPEG, GIF, and WebP images retain color on indexed-color displays; one-bit displays keep the grayscale decode and dither path.
- [webradio application](apps.md#webradio) — Stream a direct MP3 URL through the default registered audio output. On a graphical display shell, WebRadio opens a two-tab media-player GUI. On UART, USB CDC, Telnet, SSH, and other text shells, it opens a station-list TUI.
- [writer application](apps.md#writer) — Resumable graphical Markdown editor for PSRAM display boards. Inactive blocks are formatted like reader; the block containing the cursor and every block touched by a selection show their exact Markdown source. edit remains the portable text editor for port shells and boards without graphics or PSRAM.
