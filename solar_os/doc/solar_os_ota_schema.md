# SolarOS OTA Manifest Schema

SolarOS release artifacts are described by two JSON documents:

- `index.json`: a compact release index listing all board/flavor artifacts in a release or channel.
- `manifest.json`: complete metadata for one firmware image.

The release index is authenticated by a sibling `index.sig` file. The signature
is base64-encoded DER ECDSA P-256/SHA-256 over the exact `index.json` bytes.
Firmware verifies it with the embedded public key before parsing the index.

The schemas live in:

- `schemas/solaros-release-index.schema.json`
- `schemas/solaros-firmware-manifest.schema.json`

The firmware reads `index.json` from the configured OTA base URL, which defaults
to `https://solar-os.eu/ota/latest`, selects the matching board/flavor artifact,
and downloads that artifact's `firmware` path. `version.txt` is still produced
beside each firmware image for humans and simple tooling, but OTA selection is
driven by the release index.

```

`latest` may be a symlink to a versioned directory or a real directory populated by the deploy job. Paths inside `index.json` are relative to `base_url`. Paths inside a per-artifact `manifest.json` are relative to the directory that contains that manifest.

Each version directory also contains a refreshable device manual:

```text
doc/
  catalog.json
  catalog.sig
  manual.zip
  manual/
    overview.md
    python.gfx.md
    ...
```

`catalog.sig` is the same base64 DER ECDSA P-256/SHA-256 signature format as
`index.sig`, but covers the exact `catalog.json` bytes. The catalog schema is
`solaros.manual_catalog` version `2`. It names the exact firmware version and
an immutable revision, authenticates the `manual.zip` path, byte size, and
SHA-256, then records every extracted Markdown page's path, byte size, SHA-256,
metadata, and Quick reference. Firmware accepts only a catalog for its running
version, verifies the archive before extraction, and verifies every page before
activating it.

`index.sig` must be regenerated whenever `index.json` changes. A compatible
index signing flow is:

```sh
openssl dgst -sha256 -sign ota_signing_private.pem -out index.sig.der index.json
base64 -w0 index.sig.der > index.sig
printf '\n' >> index.sig
```

## Release Index

`index.json` is used to select an artifact by board and flavor without fetching every per-artifact manifest.

Required top-level fields:

- `schema`: `solaros.release_index`
- `schema_version`: currently `1`
- `project`: `SolarOS`
- `release.version`: release version
- `artifacts`: one entry per board/flavor build

Each artifact entry includes:

- `board_id`
- `flavor`
- `version`
- `manifest`
- `firmware`
- `version_file`
- `size`
- `sha256`

For a board-ID migration, the signed index may temporarily contain a second
entry with the legacy `board_id` and the canonical entry's artifact paths,
size, and SHA-256. This lets firmware compiled with the legacy ID install the
canonical firmware once. The canonical firmware then uses its new board ID on
subsequent checks. Such aliases are OTA compatibility records, not separate
builds or offline flash-catalog targets.

Optional but recommended fields:

- `base_url`
- `release.channel`
- `release.created_utc`
- `release.git_commit`
- `board_name`
- `factory_firmware`
- `capabilities`
- `groups`
- `packages`

## Firmware Manifest

`manifest.json` is the complete record for one binary.

Required top-level fields:

- `schema`: `solaros.firmware_manifest`
- `schema_version`: currently `1`
- `project`: `SolarOS`
- `version`
- `board.id`
- `board.name`
- `board.capabilities`
- `flavor.name`
- `flavor.groups`
- `flavor.packages`
- `artifact.firmware`
- `artifact.version_file`
- `artifact.size`
- `artifact.sha256`

Optional but recommended fields:

- `channel`
- `created_utc`
- `board.psram_bytes`
- `flavor.description`
- `artifact.factory_firmware`
- `artifact.content_type`
- `build.git_commit`
- `build.git_dirty`
- `build.platformio_env`
- `build.idf_version`
- `build.compiler`
- `build.partition_table`
- `build.app_partition_size`

## OTA Selection

The firmware OTA flow is:

1. Device fetches `<base>/index.json`.
2. Device fetches `<base>/index.sig`.
3. Device verifies `index.sig` against the exact `index.json` bytes.
4. Device finds an artifact where `board_id` matches the compiled board id and `flavor` matches the OTA target flavor.
5. Device compares artifact `version` with the running app version.
6. Device downloads the selected `firmware` path and streams it into the inactive OTA partition while hashing the received bytes.
7. Device verifies the received firmware stream against artifact `sha256`.
8. `esp_https_ota` finalizes image validation, then switches the boot partition.

The release index includes `sha256` and image `size`, so constrained devices can select and verify an artifact without first fetching the per-artifact manifest. The signed index protects the artifact URL, size, and SHA-256 metadata; the per-artifact `manifest.json` can be fetched later for detailed display, logging, or stricter verification.
